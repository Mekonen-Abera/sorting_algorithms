## Learning Objectives

### General

* At least four different sorting algorithms
* What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
* How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
* What is a stable sorting algorithm

### Requirements

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. 
* Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
* In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. 
* You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). 
* We will use our own main.c files at compilation. 
* Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
* Don’t forget to push your header file
* All your header files should be include guarded
* A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
